# HaloFreeLoader
Map force loader for Halo Online / Halo Free2Play

Download from the releases section: https://github.com/emoose/HaloFreeLoader/releases

Usage:
- Run HaloOnline like "eldorado.exe --account 123 --sign-in-code 123"
- Wait until it gets to the countdown screen
- Run "HaloFreeLoader.exe s3d_turf" (change s3d_turf to the map you want to load)

Noob Usage:
- Get a command prompt ready in the folder that HaloFreeLoader.exe is inside
- Write the command to load the map, ready for when the game loads (you only have a ~15 second window to run the loader)
- eg. "HaloFreeLoader.exe s3d_turf"
- Run HaloOnline like "eldorado.exe --account 123 --sign-in-code 123"
- Let it load up into the mainmenu map (the part where it starts counting down to game close)
- Alt+tab out, go to your HaloFreeLoader command prompt and hit enter
- Alt+tab back in, enjoy!
- Use task manager to kill eldorado.exe when you want to exit.
