# HaloFreeLoader
Map force loader for Halo Online / Halo Free2Play

Usage:
- Get a command prompt ready in the folder that HaloFreeLoader.exe is inside
- Write the command to load the map, ready for when the game loads (you only have a 15 second window to run the force loader)
- eg. "HaloFreeLoader.exe s3d_turf" (without quotes ofc)
- Run HaloOnline like "eldorado.exe --account 123 --sign-in-code 123" (again without quotes)
- Let it load up into the mainmenu map (the part where it starts counting down to game close)
- Alt+tab out, go to your HaloFreeLoader command prompt and hit enter
- Alt+tab back in, enjoy!
